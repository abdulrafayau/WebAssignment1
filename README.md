# SKILLSPARK // EDUCATIONAL PLATFORM

## 📖 Project Description
SKILLSPARK is a practical tech education platform designed for developers, designers, and builders. Founded on the premise that "the best way to defend is to learn to attack," the platform offers specialized training in secure development, mobile apps, and design. 

This project was developed by Abdul Rafay as "Web Technologies — Assignment No. 1" for BSIT-2-B at Air University. It features a distinct cyber aesthetic UI and serves as a front-end showcase of modern web design principles.
